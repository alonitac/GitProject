## Guidelines

1. Fork this repo and clone your forked repo locally. **Make sure you fork ALL branches, not only `main`**
2. Answer the below questions, commit your results and push them (make sure you push all the involved branches).
3. Check GitHub Actions **in your forked repo** (you may need to enable it) for test results. Make sure you pass the automatic tests of the **Students Presubmit Fork Tests** workflow. 

## Branches 

Create the following git commit tree. You can add any file you want in each commit. 
The message for each commit is denoted in the graph (`c1`, `c2`,..., `c12`). 
Note the (lightweight) tags in the merge commits and commit `c8`. 
Make sure to create exactly these names for branches and commit messages.

The parent commit of `c1` should be the last commit in branch `main` after a fresh clone of this repo (commit with message `start here`). 

```mermaid
gitGraph
       commit id: "c1"
       branch arik/bugfix1
       commit id: "c10"
       commit id: "c11"
       checkout main
       commit id: "c2"
       branch john/feature1
       checkout john/feature1
       commit id: "c3"
       checkout main
       merge arik/bugfix1 tag: "v1.0.2"
       checkout john/feature1
       branch john/feature1-test
       checkout john/feature1-test
       commit id: "c5"
       checkout main
       commit id: "c6"
       checkout john/feature1
       commit id: "c7"
       checkout main
       merge john/feature1 tag: "v1.0.3"
       checkout john/feature1-test
       commit id: "c8" tag: "john-only"
       checkout main
       commit id: "c9"
```

**Notes**:

- If you've messed up the repo, you can always checkout branch main and run `git reset --hard <commit-id>` where `<commit-id>` is the commit hash from which you need to start.
- By default, your tags aren't being pushed to remote. Make sure to push your tags using the `--tags` flag in the `git push` command.

### Test it locally

```bash
git checkout main
cd test
bash branches.sh
```

## Merge Conflict

**It's highly recommended to use a conflict merge tool (like the built-in one in PyCharm and VSCode).**

Your team colleagues, John Doe and Narayan Nadella, are working together on the same task. 
Each one of them is working on his own git branch. 

- John Doe developed under `origin/feature/version1` branch.
- Narayan Nadella developed under `origin/feature/version2` branch.

Both checked out from the same `main` branch. 

You decide to create a new branch called `feature/myfeature` and merge the work of John and Narayan into your branch. You'll encounter a conflict.

1. From `mian` branch, create and checkout `feature/myfeature` branch.
2. Merge `origin/feature/version1` into your branch, take a look on the merge changes.
3. Merge `origin/feature/version2` into your branch, and resolve the conflicts according to the below guidelines:
   - The flask webserver code under `app.py` should have a total of 8 endpoints **in the following order**: `/`, `/status`, `/blog`, `/pricing`, `/contact`, `/chat`, `/services`, `/internal`.
   - Narayan mistakenly has coded a bad port number for the service, John's branch port is correct.
   - Narayan knows better than John about the price of the service.

### Test it locally

```bash
git checkout main
cd test
bash conflict.sh
```

## Pre-commit and sensitive data 

In this repo, there is a commit which contains credentials of strong identity in AWS.
The file contains the credentials might look like:

```text
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIA6BJMA3TKBADSHFXZ
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=op7N48fxIFxh06ToUwZd33emso/QKZWb/2M5fgTX
```

Your goal is to find this commit, and completely remove it from the history. 

Here is an illustration of the vulnerable commit (the true branch name is not `some_branch`):

```mermaid
gitGraph
       branch some_branch
       checkout some_branch
       commit id: "commit1"
       commit id: "VULNERABLE_COMMIT"
       commit id: "commit 2"
       commit id: "commit 3"
```

And after your fix: 

```mermaid
gitGraph
       branch some_branch
       checkout some_branch
       commit id: "commit1"
       commit id: "some other commit 2"
       commit id: "some other commit 3"
```

Note that commits behind the vulnerable commit should remain untouched (like `commit1`),
while commit ahead the vulnerable commit might change (like `some other commit 2` and `some other commit 3`, instead of `commit 2` and `commit 3`).

Commit-wise, you are free to do whatever you wish for commits that are coming after the vulnerable commit, as far as **the content of the branch remain the same**. 
The branch content should be identical to what it was before your fix, except the vulnerable file that was committed in the `VULNERABLE_COMMIT` commit.  

There are many approaches to solve it, some are using `git reset --hard`, `git rebase` or `git cherry-pick`. Find your preferred way.
You should find the branch contains the vulnerable data, learn its structure and data, and remove the vulnerable commit carefully, without loosing data committed in other commits. 

The commit shouldn't be found also in remote branches. Since you've changed the commit history, you may be needing to `--force`fully push your fixed branch to remote. 

In order to prevent this vulnerability in the future, integrate [pre commit](https://pre-commit.com/) into your repo, and add a plugin that blocks any commits that contains AWS credentials data.
Verify that the tool is working - try to commit the below text and make sure pre-commit is blocking you.
If you were able to commit it, `git reset` your working branch to the commit before the vulnerable commit, and try again.  

### Test it locally

```bash
git checkout main
bash test/sensitive_data.sh
```

## Git workflows and remote

[Gitflow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) is a branching model for Git that provides a structure for managing feature development and releases in a software project.
It defines specific branches for each stage of the development process and enforces rules about how and when code can be merged between them.

In the Gitflow model, the main branches are:

- `main`: This branch represents the production-ready code and should always contain the latest stable release. This branch should be protected in GitHub, no one is able to push code into it directly.
- `dev`: This branch is used for ongoing development of the application and should contain the latest features that are being worked on.
- Feature branches (starts with `feature/...`): These branches are used for developing new features and should be branched off from the `dev` branch. Once the feature is complete, it is merged back into `dev` via a **Pull Request**. If everything is ok and ready to be deployed in production, the branch owner opens a Pull Request from the branch into `main`.
- Release branches (starts with `release-*`) for preparing releases. Once the code in a release branch is stable. It is merged into both `dev` and `main`. Any necessary bug fixes for the release are done in this branch.

Your goal is to implement gitflow workflow in this repo. 

**Tip**: You can always start over again by deleting the `dev`, release and feature branches (also from remote if needed), and use the `git reset --hard <commit>` command to reset the `main` branch to certain commit, while `<commit>` is the commit id last before you start this question. 

1. First, create the following [protection rules](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/managing-a-branch-protection-rule) in your GitHub repo:
   1. `dev` branch is not allowed to being pushed directly, only via Pull Request.
   2. `main` branch is read-only, only the release manager (you) can push it directly.

2. From `main`, checkout new `dev` branch.
3. From `dev` create some feature branch.
4. Create a **Pull Request** from your feature branch into `dev`, review the PR, and finally merge it into `dev` (don't use fast-forward!).
5. Observe the created GitHub action job that responsible to "deploy" the updated branch `dev` into **Development** environment (you may need to enable GitHub actions in your account - it's free).
6. From the merge commit created by the PR, create a release branch. You can call it `release-v1.2` for example. 
7. Commit some more changes in the release branch. Those changes are simulate some tiny fixes you've received from QA, some typos the product manager has fixed, and release specific content.
8. Push your release branch. Observe who is the GitHub action jos "deploying" this release to **Test** environment (also known as **Stage** env). Make your fixes if needed.
9. Once you're satisfied with results, ask your release manager (which is you) to merge your new release into `main`, push `main` and observe how the created GitHub action job is "deploying" the release to ☠️**Production** env☠️. 


In GitHub actions, workflows are defined using YAML syntax in `.github/workflows` directory of your repository.
Take a look into `.github/workflows/prod.yaml` file, which defines Production deployment pipeline.
Edit the workflow yaml file, such that the workflow is aborted when the user triggered it is not the release manager. 

## Merge two git repositories 

In a company implementing typical DevOps pipelines, different teams may be responsible for developing separate microservices of a larger application, each residing in its own Git repository.
You have been assigned the task of merging two different Git repositories, each containing separate microservices, into a single [monorepo](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/monorepos). 
The repositories were maintained by separate teams and have separate commit histories. 
Your goal is to **preserve the entire commit history** of both repositories while merging the code into a single Git repository, ensuring that the microservices remain functional and properly integrated with each other.

Merge the [GitExerciseOther](https://github.com/alonitac/GitExerciseOther.git) repo into this (GitProject) repository. 
The `main` branch of the monorepo should have the following file structure:

```text
GitProject
└── serviceA/
        ├── [service A files...]
    serviceB/
        └── [service B files...]
```

### Notes

- You are to choose what to do in the files of the GitExerciseOther repo that don't under `serviceB` directory. 
- You can commit any further change (e.g. move files into some directory) after the history of the GitExerciseOther repo has been successfully merged into this repo.  
- In case of conflicts during the merge, you should prefer this repo's version.  

### Test it locally

```bash
git checkout main
cd test
bash merge_repos.sh
